# J4502/7502, Spring 2016
Welcome to J4502: Multimedia Planning and Design

This is the repository for Multimedia Planning and Design. Here, Elizabeth and Rob will post sample code throughout the semester. You'll learn basic HTML and CSS, alongside best practices.

The Wiki is where the class syllabus, assignments and FYIs will be posted.

You'll learn how to use repositories like this throughout the semester.

For now, go ahead and download the two programs we'll be using in this class:

* Atom (text editor) [For Mac](https://atom.io) | [For Other Platforms](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.2.4)

* GitHub Desktop (aka the cat app) [For Mac](https://desktop.github.com) | [For Windows](https://desktop.github.com)

You should also have a browser on your computer. More than one is even better! A few we recommend are:

* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?product=firefox-3.6.8&os=osx%E3%80%88=en-US)

We're looking forward to the class!
